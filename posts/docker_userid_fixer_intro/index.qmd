## what is it about?

It's about a rather technical issue in using docker containers that interact with the docker host computer,
generally related to using the host filesystem inside the container. 
That happens in particular in reproducible research context. 
I developed an opensource utility that helps tackling that issue. 

## docker containers as execution  environments

The initial and main use case of a docker container: a *self-contained* application that only interacts 
with the host system with some network ports. 
Think of a web application: the docker container typically contains a web server and a web application, 
running for example on port 80 (inside the container). The container is then run on the host, by binding
the container internal port 80 to a host port (e.g. 8000). 
Then the only interaction between the containerized app and the host system is via this bound network port. 

Containers as execution environments are completely different: 

  - instead of containerizing an application, it's the **application build system** that is containerized.
      * it could a be a compiler, an IDE, a notebook engine, a Quarto publishing system...
  - the goals are:
      * to have an **standard**, easy to install and share environment
          * imagine a complex build environment, with fixed versions of R, python and zillions of external packages.
          Installing everything with the right versions can be a very difficult and time-consuming task.
          By sharing a docker image containing everything already installed and pre-configured is a real time-saver.
      * to have a **reproducible** environment
        * by using it, you are able to reproduce some analysis results, since you are using very same controlled environment
        * you can also easily reproduce bugs, which is the first step to fixing them

But, in order to use those execution environments, those containers must have access to the host system,
in particular to the host user filesystem.

## docker containers and the host filesystem

Suppose you have containerized an IDE, e.g. Rstudio. 
Your Rstudio is installed and running inside the docker container, but it needs to read and edit files 
in your project folder. 

For that you **bind mount** your project folder (in your host filesystem) using the docker run `--volume` option.
Then your files are accessible from withing the docker container. 

The challenge now are the file permissions. Suppose your host user has userid **1001**, and suppose 
that the user owning the Rsudio process in the container is either **0** (root), or **1002**.

If the container user is **root**, then it will have no issue in reading your files. 
But as soon as you edit some existing files, are produce new ones (e.g. pdf, html), these files will belong to root
**also on the host filesystem!**
Meaning that your local host user will not be able to use them, or delete them, since they belong to root.

Now if the container user id is **1002**, Rstudio may not be able to read your files, edit them or produce new files.
Even if it can, by settings some very permissive permissions, your local host user may not be able to use them.

Of course one bruteforce way of solving that issue is to run with root both on the host computer
and withing the docker container. This is not always possible and raise some obvious critical security concerns.

## solving the file owner issue part 1: the docker run `--user` option

Because we can not know in advance what will be the host userid (here **1001**), we can not pre-configure
the userid of the docker container user.

**docker run** now provides a `--user` option that enables to create a **pseudo** user with some supplied userid
at runtime. For example, `docker run --user 1001 ...` will create a docker container running with processes
belonging to a user with userid **1001**.

So what are we still discussing this issue? Isn't it solved?

Here some quirks about that dynamically created user:

- it is a pseudo user
- it does not have a home directory (/home/xxx)
- it does not appear in `/etc/passwd`
- it can not be preconfigured, e.g. with a bash profile, some env vars, application defaults etc...

We can work-around these problems, but it can be tedious and frustrating.
What we'd really like, is to pre-configure a docker container user, and be able to dynamically 
change his **userid** at **runtime**...

## solving the file owner issue part 2: enter `docker_userid_fixer`

[docker_userid_fixer](https://github.com/kforner/docker_userid_fixer) is an open source utility intended
to be used as a **docker entrypoint** to fix the userid issue I just raised.

Let's see how to use it: you set it as your docker `ENTRYPOINT`, specifying which user should be used
and have his *userid* dynamically modified:
```
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/docker_userid_fixer","user1"]
```

Let's be precise in our terms:

- the **target** user, is the user requested to docker_userid_fixer, here **user1**
- the **requested** user, is the user provisioned by `docker run`, i.e the user that (intially) owns the first process (PID 1)


Then, at the container runtime creation, there are two options:

- either the **requested** userid (already) matches the **target** userid, then nothing has to be changed
- or it does not. For example the  **requested** userid is **1001**, and the **target** userid is **100**.
Then, `docker_userid_fixer` will fix the userid of the **target**  user **user1** from 1000 to 1001, directly in the container main process.

So in practice this solves our issue:

- if you do not need to fix your container userid, just use docker run the usual way (without the `--user` option)
- or you use `--user` option, then in addition of running your main process with a userid you requested, 
  it will modify your pre-configured user to your requested userid, so that your container is running with your
  intended user and intended userid.

## docker_userid_fixer setup

You can find instructions about the setup [here](https://github.com/kforner/docker_userid_fixer#setup).

But it boils down to:

- build or download the tiny executable (17k)
- copy it into your docker image
- make it executable as setuid root
- configure it as your entrypoint

## the gory details

I have put some short notes [https://github.com/kforner/docker_userid_fixer#how-it-works](https://github.com/kforner/docker_userid_fixer#how-it-works)
but I'll try to rephrase.

The crux of the implementation is the **setuid root** of the `docker_userid_fixer` executable in the container.
We need root permissions to change the userid, and this setuid enables that privileged execution only for 
the `docker_userid_fixer`program, and that for a very short time.

As soon as the userid has been modified if needed, `docker_userid_fixer` will switch the main process 
to the requested user (and userid!).
