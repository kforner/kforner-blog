My **Rfuzzycoco** package just hit the CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfuzzycoco/index.html !!
Publishing to CRAN is a rigorous process, and it was particularly challenging as this package includes custom C++ code. 
I documented the preparation process, including the steps needed for C++ integration, in a previous post: [Preparing Rfuzzycoco for publication on CRAN](../preparing_rfuzzycoco_for_cran/)

**The Fuzzy CoCo Algorithm**

The core algorithm, *Fuzzy CoCo: a cooperative-coevolutionary approach to fuzzy modeling* 
ingeniously combines **fuzzy logic** with cooperative **genetic algorithms** to evolve clear, human-understandable models, making it a powerful tool for explainable machine learning (XAI).

**The C++ Foundation**
To make **Rfuzzycoco** possible, I first had to reimplement from scratch the main legacy **Fuzzy CoCo** implementation, 
which I released as the **fuzzycoco** C++ library, available here: [https://github.com/Lonza-RND-Data-Science/fuzzycoco](https://github.com/Lonza-RND-Data-Science/fuzzycoco). You can read more details about this in my post: 
[fuzzycoco: C++ open-source release of my re-implementation of the Fuzzy Coco algorithm](../fuzzycoco_release/).

**Get started**
If you are interested in predicting or classifying your data with simple, human understandable, stable rules, give **Rfuzzycoco** a try, or reach out to me. I'm also open to collaborations, as there are many exciting opportunities to enhance both the implementation and the algorithm itself.
