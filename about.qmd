I am a computer scientist (and mathematician) by training, and always worked in bioinformatics and pharmaceutical field.
I am really experienced in R programming (but I also code in Perl, Python, C++, java) and more generally in setting up and leading software development platforms, in particular for reproducible research. 
In particular I pioneered the use of docker containers as reproducible computing development environments.


I am also fond of software optimization and parallelization.



Lately, I'm working as a consultant, so don't hesitate to contact me if you like my work. 

And I am a fervent proponent of OpenSource software:
